# µµJ - Micro My Java

This is an introductory workshop on developing microservices with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/).

The workshop requires at the very least that you have a Java Development Kit 8 or higher,
or that you can run Docker to build the application in a container.

For working with Micronaut, it is recommended that you install the Micronaut CLI.
Because the project is already set up using the tool for this workshop,
you can get by without it, but you probably want to install it for future use.
See [Download Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/download.html) for installation instructions.
